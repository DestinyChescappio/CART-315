Make a Thing! 
This week was the first time I experimented with tiny game engines. I am pleased we did not dive straight into coding (though this class focuses on C## in unity), I was not the type of artist to be perfect at coding but I enjoy it. I experimented with bitsy and I am glad I chose this mini engine as it is quite easy to work with and very beginner friendly. I also found that bitsy brought some nostalgia considering it is pixel based. I made a bitsy game called, “Mewmew’s Gift giving” which was a cat being granted permission to explore its owner’s garden and collect an array of funky items. Though it was not a win or lose game and more of an exploration game, I had fun experimenting with this sort of exploration game. I was happy with the outcome however there were a few things to keep in mind which was to properly set the garden’s walls as objects that prevent the cat from going through. I would have like to explore more into making complex games with additional designs; I learned I am able to work with my own pixel designs that have more detail and color variation, and also incorporate my own unique code to the bitsy html file. Overall, bitsy is an overall great tool for beginners and an excellent starting point to a bigger and more complex game.

Pawng!
This week was a stretch for me considering I just gotten into C## coding with Unity. I find using C## and Unity is a bit challenging but I have hopes I will get better. Anyways, this week’s exercise was to complete or add onto the last in-class exercise, SleepyTimes, which basically was an introduction exercise to Unity and basic CC## coding. I was able to implement the Pawng template to my own scene in Unity with the sleepy time objects however I feel like I forgotten some parts to add onto my code which I will try to add and fix later before class. I like to think of myself as organized and having everything in one place, a document if you may. It would be nice to have the instructions to these mini exercises in an official document or PDF that could be posted on the website or moodle instead of discord where things may get lost or misread. Aside from that, I enjoyed doing this mini activity with the basics, and I plan to add more stuff to it like adding the score board in a text that changes each time a player gets a score. 
Feedback from peers:
-	Decrease the bed’s box collider so the ball will collide closer to the bed.
-	Friction with the ball – prevent it from getting stuck. 
-	Make the ball become faster overtime. 
-	Add a cool scoreboard.

Breakout!
What you need to make it:
•	Field of bricks
•	Array of game objects 
•	A paddle
•	A ball that goes neither left or right (random direction) 
•	Walls L/R, U – bounce, F – Respawn
•	Scoreboard (Use canvas UI text in unity)
•	Awake is ran before start
I find making a list like this is useful when starting a game. It gives me a clear idea what I need to do and doing it bit-by-bit is key!

Breakout!... Breakdown
Breakout exercise was a bit challenging considering its physics but I do have a broad understanding that breakout is basically pawng but with different behaviors and positions. The new component is its brick behaviors which I will most likely go back and study it. Last class I could not really be engaged due to my coughing and sniffling (I was battling a cold at the time) and was left behind with additional stages of the breakout exercise. Though the pro is welcome to help, I felt as though my consistent hand raises and coughs were disrupting the class so I left early. Besides that, I went to the computation lab for help and had a better understanding of how things worked and why I kept running into errors. However, I feel as though some errors are not explainable and sometimes are due to spontaneous algorithms. I just hope this upcoming class won’t be as harsh as the last… 
Notes to keep in mind:
-	Have not figured out the scoreboard display though it is triggered in the debug/log so maybe separate each “point” component (eg: the heart.png) instead of one single image?

Breakout: peer feedback
·	Change paddle horizontal limit (must not go past wall) 
·	Add an acceleration to the ball (has something to do with material?)
·	Fix the brick’s space/distance with each other. 
·	Add a scoreboard (will learn from prof tonight)
